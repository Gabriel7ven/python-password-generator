## Overview
This project is solution to the 5th day's challenge  of the course '100 Days of Code' in Python with Dr. Angela Yu.
The challenge was to build a password generator in two different levels of difficulty: Easy and Hard.
When the program is running, it's asked to the user three different questions:
- How many letters would you like in your password?
- How many symbols would you like?
- How many numbers would you like?

After to press the key Enter, it's displayed the password.

## Easy Level
In this level although the characteres are generated randomly in each list, list aren't chose randomly but in sequence.
So the characteres are grouped one to another depending from wich list they comes from. 
See the screenshot bellow, I think that it helps to understand better:

## Hard Level
In this level, different of the easy level, the characteres might be placed randomly even the characteres of the same group (letters, symbols ou numbers).
Building this project in the hard level was actually hard, because I didn't use much built-in functions of the random python library, indeed I build it using so much more if/else statements.
See the screenshot bellow, I think that it helps to understand better:

After watching the solution provided by Dr. Angela Yu, who used built-in functions like random.choice() and random.shuffle(), I was really surprised with the simplicity of her solution.
